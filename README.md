This project was build as an angular application.
Two services are defines within the solution which would be resposible for fetching the job and candidate details.
The details fetched from the service will be mapped to appropriate models and then some processing would be done to show te data in front end.
Front end is plain html with little css and bootstrap support added.

Brief description of how to match candidate to a job:
---------------------------------
The candidate with maximum number would be displayed first ,ie it would be sorted in the order of maximum to minimum matching skillset.

Build the solution:
-------------------------
1.Download the solution.
2.run npm install.
3. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
